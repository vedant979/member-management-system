# Member Management System - .NET

## Description
A Member Management System built using .NET that allows administrators to manage members, including creating, updating, and deleting member records. The system provides features for viewing, searching, and sorting member information. It supports authentication and authorization mechanisms for administrators and users.

## Features
- **Member CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete member records.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Admin users can manage the system, while regular users can view their details.
- **Search and Filter**: Search and filter members based on different attributes (e.g., name, ID, membership status).
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to be mobile and desktop friendly using .NET MVC.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET 6/7** (or specify the version you're using)
- **Entity Framework** for database operations
- **SQL Server** (or other database of choice)
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** for web application
- **Bootstrap** (or any other front-end framework for responsive design)
- **Identity** for user authentication and authorization
